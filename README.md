Employee Diversity Project
(My first every SQL project)

Overview
Welcome to my employee project repository! This project aims to show how I can use SQL for people analysis in an organisation.

Features
- Joins - inner and right joins on employee names, salaries and managers
- Subquery - determining who is earning </> than the average salary
- Views - saving various joins which also allows me to filter for just females in an organisation, can call on the view anytime 
- Group by and having - how many employees in each job role, which job role is understaffed or overstaffed
- Stored function - using a saved calculation to determine the annual bonus for each employee (also using CASE WHEN)
- Reverse engineer
